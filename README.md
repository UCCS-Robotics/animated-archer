quadcopter
==========

This quadcopter will be designed to use localized sensor data to accuratly search and identify persons or objects of interest and interact with an operational base to efficiently complete the mission. The quadcopter must be able to perform in hostile environments and make path decisions within the defined mission parameters. Communication with the operational base will be kept to a minimum: telemetry, status, high-level commands, and video. The quadcopter must be able to adapt to changes in the operational environment and to physical damage/interaction to the vehicle.
